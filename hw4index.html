    <h1>Progressive Web Application (PWA)</h1>

    <p class="PWAchar">PWA which is short for Progressive Web Application is very beneficial to the interface of mobile web applications.<br>
        It allows the web applications to operate more smoothly, faster, and become more engaging. What PWA does is to improve the usability <br>
        of the applications such as having quicker loading times and eye catching appearance as well as the ability to use offline. </p>

    <p class="PWAchar">So having PWA will help your needs for your mobile web applications, but there are some requirements neccessary for <br>
        a functioning PWA. That would be manifest files and a service worker. A manifest file lets the web developer format the appearance <br>
        for the users. Service workers are used to fix problems within the applications.</p>
